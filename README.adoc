# Make your App Material

## Project Overview
In this project, I redesigned an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translated a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## Why this Project?
This project gave me an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps that users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What did I Learn?
Throughout this project, I learned:

- Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
- Apply Material Design guidelines to a mobile application.
- Separate an interface into surfaces.
- Effectively use transitions and motion.

## Required Tasks
- Download a zip file of the app.
- Read the UI Review in the next node.
- Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways it could be improved.
